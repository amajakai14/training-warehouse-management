# Third lesson

## Add Data that into Database

### Tutorial

run our `DemoApplication` once again

open `order.html` file
now you will see a form to let you add new order
let's try to add a new order and see what's happen

now try to understand the code a bit by bit and answer to yourself of these below questions

- ui
  - what is [formData](https://magazine.techacademy.jp/magazine/21089)
  - what is `method`, `headers`, `body` ?
    - last time we didn't use any of this!
- server
  - What is `ExampleOrderRequest` Class
  - What does `validate()` do?
  - How do you jump between each `Controller`, `Service`, `Repository`, `Datasource` if you want to check How code is implemented
    - Hint: Try to use hotkey `Ctrl + b` and `Ctrl + Shift + b`

### Exercise

in exercise.html there is a button to show menu which is broken. Try to make it work!
Hint: I have comment some steps to do in Java already let's find them!

### Migration

Don't Worry if if you add some data to Database but it's gone after you restart the server  
Normally, It woud not but I did config it to reset the data every time you run the server that's call migration  
We will talk about it later
